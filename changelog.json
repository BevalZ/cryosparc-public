   "description": "<ul>\n<li>Installer works without curl (uses wget instead)</li>\n<li>Allow clearing cache and changing reserve space when cryosparc is stopped. Cache reserve is now 10GB by default. Make sure cryosparc checks for free disk space (5GB) before starting.</li>\n<li>MongoDB and NodeJS are not auto-restarted when they crash, to protect from possible db corruption.</li>\n<li>Installer now sets all package versions exactly to avoid conflicts.</li>\n<li>Removed cryosparc restart command because it didn't work correctly. Use stop and start for now.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug when there are spaces in the cryosparc installation directory.</li>\n<li>Added changelog to dashboard.</li>\n</ul>",
